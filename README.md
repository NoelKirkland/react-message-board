## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The purpose of the project is to simulate a message board using purely functional components in React.js, using Redux to handle all necessary state.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](Node.js)
2. A code editor

### Installing

1. First, you'll need a copy of the repo, by clicking the download button above.
2. Grab the necessary packages with `npm install`
3. Open a development version of the project with `npm start`, which will open in your browser automatically. If it doesn't, type `localhost:3000` into your browser's navigation bar. This version of the project will reload if you should make any changes to the code-base, so you can watch updates in real time.
4. Alternately, get a production copy of the project with `npm run build`, which will create an .html file in the build folder. This version of the project will be more optimized, but will not update automatically as you edit the code-base.

## 🔧 Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Just run `npm test`, and let jest do the rest!


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

It should be fairly straightforward, just click the buttons.

## 🚀 Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>
